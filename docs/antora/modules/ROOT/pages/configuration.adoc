= Configuration

.Cloud native applications can be configured according to different strategies.
[%header,cols="15%, 50%"]
|===
|Configuration strategy|Characteristics
|Property files packaged with the application a|

* These files can act as specifications of what configuration data the application supports. 
* These are useful for defining sensible default values, mainly oriented to the development environment.

|Environment variables a|
* Environment variables are supported by any operating system, so they are great for portability. 
* Most programming languages allow you access to the environment variables.
In Java you can access them with the System.getenv() method.
In Spring you can also rely on the Environment abstraction. 
* These are useful for defining configuration data that depends on the infrastructure
and platform where the application is deployed, such as active
profiles, hostnames, service names, and port numbers.
|Configuration Service a|
* Provides configuration data persistence, auditing, and accountability. 
* Allows secrets management by using encryption or dedicated secret vaults. 
* This is useful for defining configuration data specific to the application, such
as connection pools, credentials, feature flags, thread pools, and URLs to
third-party services.

== Propeties: Key/Value pairs for configuration
Properties are key/value pairs supported in Java as first-class citizens with java.util
.Properties. They play an essential role in many applications for storing configuration
parameters outside of the compiled Java code. Spring Boot automatically loads
them from different sources. When the same property is defined in multiple sources,
there are rules that determine which one takes precedence. For example, if you
specify a value for the _server.port_ property both in a property file and a commandline
argument, the latter takes precedence over the former. The following is a prioritized
list of some of the most common property sources, starting with the highest
priority:

. @TestPropertySource annotations on test classes
. Command-line arguments
. JVM System properties from System.getProperties()
. OS environment variables from System.getenv()
. Configuration data files
. @PropertySource annotations on @Configuration classes
. Default properties from SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties

Configuration data files can be further prioritized, starting with the highest
priority:

. Profile-specific application properties from *_application-{profile}.properties_* and
*_application-{profile}.yml_* files packaged outside your JAR
. Application properties from *_application.properties_* and *_application.yml_* files
packaged outside your JAR
. Profile-specific application properties from *_application-{profile}.properties_* and
*_application-{profile}.yml_* files packaged inside your JAR
. Application properties from application.properties and application.yml files
packaged inside your JAR


Some code follows showing how to access any property key/value.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private Environment environment;

public String getServerPort() {
    return environment.getProperty("server.port");
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Value("${server.port}")
private String serverPort;

public String getServerPort() {
    return serverPort;
}
----

Lastly and the now the recommended by the *_Spring Team_*.

== Profiles: Feature flags and configuration groups
This section presents Spring profiles in the context of two different use cases: feature
flags and configuration groups.

=== Using Profiles as feature flags
Cosider your application uses data to operate, like loading a catalog of books, you could 
getnerate some test data at startup when in development or test phase of the application and not
tied this to a specific environment. Hence, loading test data can be modeled as a feature that you
enable or disable through configuration. You could define a *_testdata_* profile to toggle
the loading of this test data, keeping the profile independent from the deployment environment.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of using profiles as feature flags, a more scalable and structured
approach is defining custom properties to configure functionality, and
relying on annotations such as *_@ConditionalOnProperty_* and *_@ConditionalOnCloudPlatform_* to control when certain beans should be loaded into the
Spring application context. That's one of the foundations of Spring Boot autoconfiguration.
For example, you could define a polar.testdata.enabled custom
property and use the _@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "polar.testdata
.enabled", havingValue = "true")_ annotation on the BookDataLoader class.
====

=== Using Profiles as configuration groups
Using this mechanism allows your application to load configuration data only when a spcific profile is active. This is done by adding a suffix of the profile name to the *_application.yml_* file, for
example if the profile name is _dev_, then the file would be namedas *_application-dev.ymel_* and any key/value defined would take precedence to any defined in *_application.yml_*.

=== Retrieving properties
Let's evaluate the *_polar.greeting_*.

If you run 
[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar build/libs/catalog-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

The value is taken from the *_application.yml_* value as 'Welcome to the local book catalog!'.

if you run

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar build/libs/catalog-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
--polar.greeting="Welcome to the catalog from CLI"
----

It overrides the value defined in *_application.yml_*.

if you run 

[source,bash]
----
java -Dpolar.greeting="Welcome to the catalog from JVM" \
-jar build/libs/catalog-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

It overrides the value defined in *_application.yml_*.

If you define the _polar.greeting_ both in the CLI and JVM, it will use the CLI over the JVM value (see precedence rules above).

Both CLI arguments and JVM properties let you externalize the configuration and keep
the application build immutable. However, they require different commands to run the
application, which might result in errors at deployment time. A better approach is using
environment variables, as recommended by the 15-Factor methodology.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables defined in the operating system are commonly used for
externalized configuration, and they are the recommended option according to the
15-Factor methodology. One of the advantages of environment variables is that every
operating system supports them, making them portable across any environment.
====

To turn _polar.greeting_ into and ENV variable you type it as follows _POLAR_GREETING_.
So you can use it as 

[source,bash]
----
$ POLAR_GREETING="Welcome to the catalog from ENV" \
$ java -jar build/libs/catalog-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Configuration Repo (Git datastore)
Define the external non-sensitive information about application configuration following the
*_Spring Cloud Config_* conventions.

* *_{application}:* The name of the application as defined by the _spring.application.name_ property.
* *{profile}:* One of the active profiles defined by the _spring.profiles.active_ property.
* *{label}:* A discriminator defined by the specific configuration data repository.
In the case of Git, it can be a tag, a branch name, or a commit ID. Itâ€™s useful for
identifying a versioned set of config files.

Depending on your needs, you can organize the folder structure using different combinations,
such as these:

/{application}/application-{profile}.yml +
/{application}/application.yml +
/{application}-{profile}.yml + 
/{application}.yml +
/application-{profile}.yml +
/application.yml +


After you have setup the *_Configuration Server_*, you can access its rest API to get data.

[source, bash]
----
$ http :8888/catalog-service/default <1>
----
<1> Connect to localhost using Httpie client and retrieves the default configuration.

Spring Cloud Config Server exposes properties through a series of endpoints using
different combinations of the *_{application}_*, *_{profile}_*, and *_{label}_* parameters:

/{application}/{profile}[/{label}] +
/{application}-{profile}.yml +
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml +
/{application}-{profile}.properties +
/{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties +
