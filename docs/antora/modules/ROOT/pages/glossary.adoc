== A
* *A/B Test:* Refers to the way a test is conducted with different paths.
* *AC:* Acceptance Criteria.
* *ADA:* Americans with Disabilities Act.
* *ADM:* Application Development Maintenance.
* *AKA:* Acronym for *Also known as*.
* *AID:* Acronym for *Application Infrastructure Diagram*.
* *API:* Acronym for *Application Programming Interface*.
* *API contract:* A view of an *Application Programming Interface*
(API) as a formal agreement between the caller and the callee. Often, unit
tests help define the API contract by demonstrating the expected behavior.
* *APM:* Application Performance Management.
* *ARN:* Amazon Resource Name.
* *ART:* Average Response Time (term used in Profiler apps).

== C
* *CLI:* Command Line Interface.
* *CMD:* Refers to a command line interface program in the *Operating System*,
also know as *Command Line Interface (CLI)*.
* *CTA:* Call to Action.

== E
* *ECR:* Used in AWS for https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[*_Elastic Container Registry_*^], 
aka, Docker image registry.
* *ECS:* Used in AWS for https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[*_Elastic Container Services_*^],
which is a service to launch any Dockerized application in the AWS cloud.
* *EFM:* Enhancement Factory Model.

== F
* *Framework:* A semicomplete application that provides a reusable
common structure to share among applications. Developers incorporate the
framework into their own applications and extend it to meet their specific
needs. Frameworks differ from toolkits by providing a coherent structure
rather than a simple set of utility classes. A framework defines a skeleton, and
the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton. The developer
code is called appropriately by the framework. Developers can worry less
about whether a design is good and focus more on implementing domainspecific
functions.

== H
* *HR:* Human Resources.

== J
* *JSON:* (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and 
generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is 
completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to 
programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, 
JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. 
These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

* *JSONPath:* It is a query language for JSON, similar to XPath for XML.

== R
* *Redis:* It is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, 
in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.
Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, 
lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial
indexes.

== S
* *SAP:* Enterprise Resource Planning software developed by German Company SAP ERP. 
* *SLA:* Service-Level Agreement.
* *SI:* System Integration.
* *SIT:* System Integration Testing.

== T
* *Tredir:* Tredir is a IP:Geolocation service hosted in AWS. It provides a 
reasonably accurate geographic location of a particular IP address. 
Our customers teams use Tredir to improve customer experience by serving 
more relevant content based on geographic location (primary language, Country, 
state), and in some cases geofencing for content.

== U
* *Unit Test:* A test that examines the behavior of a distinct unit of
work. A unit of work is a task that is not directly dependent on the completion
of any other task. Within a Java application, the distinct unit of work is often,
but not always, a single method.

== V
* *VPN:* Acronym for *Virtual Private Network*.
