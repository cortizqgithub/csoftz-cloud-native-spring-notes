= Reactive Programming


--> Copy the image 8.1 and 8.2 to showcase this.


Scale and cost optimization are two critical reasons for moving to the cloud, so the
reactive paradigm perfectly fits cloud native applications. Scaling applications to support
a workload increase becomes less demanding. By using resources more efficiently,
you can save money on the computational resources offered by a cloud provider.
Another reason for moving to the cloud is resilience, and reactive applications also
help with that.

One of the essential features of reactive applications is that they provide nonblocking
backpressure (also called control flow). This means that consumers can control
the amount of data they receive, which lowers the risk of producers sending more
data than consumers can handle, which can cause a DoS attack, slowing the application,
cascading the failure, or even leading to a total crash.

The reactive paradigm is a solution to the problem of blocking I/O operations that
require more threads to handle high concurrency and which may lead to slow or entirely
unresponsive applications. Sometimes the paradigm is mistaken as a way to increase the
speed of an application. Reactive is about improving scalability and resilience, not speed.

With great powers come great troubles, though. Going reactive is an excellent
choice when you expect high traffic and concurrency with fewer computational
resources or in streaming scenarios. However, you should also be aware of the additional
complexity introduced by such a paradigm. Besides requiring a mindset shift to
think in an event-driven way, reactive applications are more challenging to debug and
troubleshoot because of the asynchronous I/O. Before rushing to rewrite all your
applications to make them reactive, think twice about whether thatâ€™s necessary, and
consider both the benefits and drawbacks.

Conceptually, reactive streams resemble the Java Stream API in the way we use them
to build data pipelines. One of the key differences is that a Java stream is pull-based:

consumers process data in an imperative and synchronous fashion. Instead, reactive
streams are push-based: consumers are notified by the producers when new data is
available, so the processing happens asynchronously.
