Use Spring Cloud Consul for Service Discovery pattern. -> THis is CLIENT SIDE Service discovery.
Use Spring Cloud Load Balancer. --> Client mode

Pattern Hedging in Cloud Distributed Microservices ????

== Service discovery and Spring Cloud Kubernetes

If you need to migrate existing applications that use one of the client-side service discovery
options I mentioned in the previous section, you can use Spring Cloud Kubernetes
to make the transition smoother. You can keep your existing service discovery
and load-balancing logic in your application. However, instead of solutions like Spring
Cloud Netflix Eureka, you can use the Spring Cloud Kubernetes Discovery Server for
service registry. This can be a convenient way to migrate applications to Kubernetes
without changing too much in your application code. For more information, refer to
the project documentation: https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-kubernetes.
Unless what youâ€™re doing requires specific handling of service instances and load balancing
in your applications, my recommendation is to migrate over time to using the
native service discovery functionality offered by Kubernetes, aiming at removing infrastructural
concerns from your applications.


== Windows check for used ports

[source,bash]
----
$ netstat -aon <1>
----
<1> Check for listening status.
